SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation is a widely used and compact way to represent.  the structure of chemical compounds, including organic molecules. 

Here are some SMILES Notations

Methane (CH4):

SMILES Notation: C
Ethanol (C2H5OH):

SMILES Notation: CCO
Water (H2O):

SMILES Notation: O
Benzene (C6H6):

SMILES Notation: c1ccccc1
Caffeine (C8H10N4O2):

SMILES Notation: CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C

In SMILES notation, each character or combination of characters represents specific atoms and bonds in the molecule's structure. Some common SMILES conventions include:

Elements are represented by their atomic symbols (e.g., C for carbon, O for oxygen).
Single bonds are typically implied between adjacent atoms (e.g., CO represents a single bond between carbon and oxygen).
Double bonds are represented by = (e.g., C=C for a double bond between two carbon atoms).
Triple bonds are represented by #.
Aromatic rings are enclosed in lowercase letters (e.g., c1ccccc1 for benzene).
